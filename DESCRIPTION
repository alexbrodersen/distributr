Title: Apply a function over grid of parameters, with SGE backend
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Patrick Miller
Maintainer: Patrick Miller <pmille13@nd.edu>
Description: Provides a function grid_apply that applies a function over a grid of its arguments (e.g. \code{expand.grid(a=1:4, b=3:5))}), returning results in a list. Function applications can be executed repeatedly and in parallel. A backend for execution of these grids is provided for Sun Grid Engine. Results can be easy transformed into a tidy format.
